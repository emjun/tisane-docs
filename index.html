            <p class="lead">Tisane is an interactive system for authoring generalized linear models (GLMs) and generalized linear mixed-effects models (GLMMs). It provides a <emph>study design specification language</emph> to author conceptually founded linear models that are optimized for generalizability.
            <p>
                Tisane's study design specification language allows analysts to specify conceptual and data relationships between variables. Analysts can query Tisane for a linear model involving specific variables of interest. Tisane checks the query is well-formed based on the expressed relationships and automatically generates a space of possible linear models that respect the stated relationships. Tisane asks analysts disambiguating questions about their analysis intents through a graphical user interface (GUI). Based on the specified study design and additional responses, Tisane outputs code for fitting and visualizing a statistical model. The output model is guaranteed to be conceptually consistent with the specified relationships and optimized for generalizability.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tisane is designed for analysts who have domain expertise, are not statistical experts, and are comfortable with minimal programming  (e.g., many researchers).
            </p>
            <p>
                The Tisane project is currently active at the University of Washington's Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science.
